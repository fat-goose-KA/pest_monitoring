cam2web 1.1.0 release notes
-------------------------------------------
30.08.2017.

Version updates and fixes:

* The REST API is updated to provide description of camera's properties (GET request to
  /camera/properties). This description allows now to have common WebUI, which renders
  camera's properties for all supported APIs (DirectShow, V4L, MMAL).
* New configuration option is added to specify name of a streamed camera, which is displayed
  in WebUI.
* Windows: Added configuration option to override default camera's frame rate. It allows
  to choose from a range of supported frame rates. Note: not all frame rate values will work.
  This is caused by limitations of DirectShow API and simply some bad camera drivers, which
  don't care about what they report.
* Windows: Main application's window now shows actual camera's frame rate.
* Windows: Optimized BGR to RGB conversion using SSSE3 instructions if CPU supports those.
* Windows: Main window's icon and system tray's icon (if minimized) show an indication of
  web activity - when the streamed camera is accessed.
* Windows: Added an option to specify folder for custom WebUI using folder selection form.
* Windows: Added configuration option to specify color of window/tray icon. This makes it
  easier to distinguish multiple instances of the application streaming different cameras.
